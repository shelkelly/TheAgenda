# The Agenda

## What the App Does
- Add a to-do item
- Mark a to-do item as completed
- Remove a completed to-do from the list
- Saves both to-do items and completed to-do items to Local Storage
- Both lists resume when you navigate away from and return to the page

## Why is it useful?
The Agenda was created as a fun and interactive way to get my children interested in completing chores (which ended up being very dependent on personality, by the way). People are able to quickly add in things that need to be done. It helps to keep you organized and on track.

Once you finish an item, it moves to a completed list. It is a nice dopamine boost to be able to see and keep track of what you have accomplished!

Didn't finish your stuff from the day before? No worries, it's still there. You won't forget what you needed to do, and you can still "Complete" and "Remove" things that need to change!
